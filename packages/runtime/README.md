# Pug Trusted Types Runtime

Functions that coerce inputs to values safe to use in context.

See [web-contract-types](https://npmjs.com/package/web-contract-types)
for definitions of "safe" and "context".

This is supporting code for the
[Trusted Types Plugin](https://npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-trusted-types)
for the [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) template language.
